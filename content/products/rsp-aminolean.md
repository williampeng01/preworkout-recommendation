Important Ingredients
=============
***The ingredients are measured by serving***

### **Caffeine 125mg**
> An adenosine receptor antagonist and has been shown to acutely improve cognition as well as performance during endurance, power, and resistance exercise when consumed in dosages between 3 and 6 mg/kg bodyweight.

### **Beta-Alanine**
-------------
> Enhances performance by increasing exercise capacity and decreasing muscle fatigue. It does this by acting as an intramuscular buffering protein to increase carnosine levels, which helps to buffer acid from the muscles, reduce lactic acid buildup, and thus enables you to work longer and harder without hitting the wall of fatigue. The consumption of 4-6 g β-alanine per day over a period of at least 2 weeks has been demonstrated to improve high-intensity exercise performance.

[**BCAAs**](https://www.webmd.com/vitamins/ai/ingredientmono-1005/branched-chain-amino-acids)
-------------
### Leucine, L-Isoleucine, and L-Valine
> Leucine, is considered to be the main and most important BCAA amino acid for the many benefits it provides to the body. It is particularly popular for its ability to build muscles and activate a protein known as mTOR, which triggers muscle protein synthesis. The  isoleucine and valine also help activate mTOR, but not in such strength as leucine. Leucine plays an essential role in muscle recovery. 

### **L-Arginine**
> An amino acid that is a precursor required for the synthesis of nitric oxide.

### **L-Carnitine**
> L-Carnitine helps tranform body fat into energy. It also helps decreasing physical and mental fatigue. The qualities make it beneficial for focus and cutting.

### **Taurine**
> An amino-containing sulfonic acid that has been reported to have antioxidant, metabolic, and ergogenic effects. While chronic consumption of the substance may improve time-to-exhaustion during endurance. exercise, acute ingestion of 1.5 g taurine as part of a MIPS has been shown to improve muscular endurance during resistance exercise. 

### **Tyrosine**
>  It is directly involved in the creation of the neurotransmitter’s dopamine and adrenaline, a family of hormones called catecholamines. Supplementing with L-Tyrosine can be particularly useful during times when we are under stress and have an increased demand for both neurotransmitters and catecholamine hormones. Consuming Tyrosine prior to training will increase dopamine and adrenaline release which improves exercise tolerance, motivation and focus.

### CLA
> Helps reduce body fat and increase focus.

### Green Tea extract
> Contains theanine. Can improve metabolism, digestion, and focus.
