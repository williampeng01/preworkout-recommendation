Ingredients
=============
***The ingredients are measured by serving***

### **Caffeine 150mg**
> An adenosine receptor antagonist and has been shown to acutely improve cognition as well as performance during endurance, power, and resistance exercise when consumed in dosages between 3 and 6 mg/kg bodyweight.

### **Creatine 2g**
>  Creatine is a naturally-occurring amino acid found in the muscle of various animals. Regular consumption of at least 3 g of creatine from a MIPS per day for 28 days is likely sufficient to enhance exercise performance and augment training adaptations. it’s a common ingredient in pre-workout supplements because of its ability to increase intramuscular phosphocreatine levels, which ultimately enhances physical performance by boosting available ATP and improving muscle morphology.

### **Beta-Alanine 2g**
>  Enhances performance by increasing exercise capacity and decreasing muscle fatigue. It does this by acting as an intramuscular buffering protein to increase carnosine levels, which helps to buffer acid from the muscles, reduce lactic acid buildup, and thus enables you to work longer and harder without hitting the wall of fatigue. The consumption of 4-6 g β-alanine per day over a period of at least 2 weeks has been demonstrated to improve high-intensity exercise performance.

### **Citric Acid**
> Manufacturers use citric acid to make their pre-workout powders more water soluble. Otherwise, you would have a hard time mixing them with liquids.

### **L-Citrulline 4g**
> Increases nitric oxide production, increase blood flow to active muscles. Mixed with Malic Acid to produce Citrulline Malate

### **Betaine 2.5g**
> Also know as trimethylglycine, it is a naturally-occurring derivative of the amino acid glycine which may improve exercise performance by increasing rates of creatine synthesis, elevating levels of blood nitric oxide, and promoting fluid and thermal homeostasis

### **Tyrosine 750mg**
>  It is directly involved in the creation of the neurotransmitter’s dopamine and adrenaline, a family of hormones called catecholamines. Supplementing with L-Tyrosine can be particularly useful during times when we are under stress and have an increased demand for both neurotransmitters and catecholamine hormones. Consuming Tyrosine prior to training will increase dopamine and adrenaline release which improves exercise tolerance, motivation and focus.
