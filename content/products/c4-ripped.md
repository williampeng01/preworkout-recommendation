***The ingredients are measured by serving***

### **Caffeine 135mg**
>  An adenosine receptor antagonist and has been shown to acutely improve cognition as well as performance during endurance, power, and resistance exercise when consumed in dosages between 3 and 6 mg/kg bodyweight.

### **Taurine**
> An amino-containing sulfonic acid that has been reported to have antioxidant, metabolic, and ergogenic effects. While chronic consumption of the substance may improve time-to-exhaustion during endurance. exercise, acute ingestion of 1.5 g taurine as part of a MIPS has been shown to improve muscular endurance during resistance exercise.

It does this by acting as an intramuscular buffering protein to increase carnosine levels, which helps to buffer acid from the muscles, reduce lactic acid buildup, and thus enables you to work longer and harder without hitting the wall of fatigue. The consumption of 4-6 g β-alanine per day over a period of at least 2 weeks has been demonstrated to improve high-intensity exercise performance.

### **Citrulline Malate**
> A blend of L-Citrulline and Malic Acid, Increases nitric oxide production, increase blood flow to active muscles. 

### **L-Carnitine**
> L-Carnitine helps tranform body fat into energy. It also helps decreasing physical and mental fatigue. The qualities make it beneficial for focus and cutting.
