Important Ingredients
=============
***The ingredients are measured by serving***

### **Caffeine 333mg**
>  An adenosine receptor antagonist and has been shown to acutely improve cognition as well as performance during endurance, power, and resistance exercise when consumed in dosages between 3 and 6 mg/kg bodyweight.

### **Taurine 100mg**
> An amino-containing sulfonic acid that has been reported to have antioxidant, metabolic, and ergogenic effects. While chronic consumption of the substance may improve time-to-exhaustion during endurance. exercise, acute ingestion of 1.5 g taurine as part of a MIPS has been shown to improve muscular endurance during resistance exercise. 

### **Beta-Alanine 3.2g**
> Enhances performance by increasing exercise capacity and decreasing muscle fatigue. It does this by acting as an intramuscular buffering protein to increase carnosine levels, which helps to buffer acid from the muscles, reduce lactic acid buildup, and thus enables you to work longer and harder without hitting the wall of fatigue. The consumption of 4-6 g β-alanine per day over a period of at least 2 weeks has been demonstrated to improve high-intensity exercise performance.

### **Citrulline Malate 6g**
> A blend of L-Citrulline and Malic Acid, Increases nitric oxide production, increase blood flow to active muscles. 

### **Citric Acid**
>Manufacturers use citric acid to make their pre-workout powders more water soluble. Otherwise, you would have a hard time mixing them with liquids.
