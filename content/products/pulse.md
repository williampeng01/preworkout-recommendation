Important Ingredients
=============
***The ingredients are measured by serving***

### **Caffeine 350mg**
>  An adenosine receptor antagonist and has been shown to acutely improve cognition as well as performance during endurance, power, and resistance exercise when consumed in dosages between 3 and 6 mg/kg bodyweight.

### **L-Theanine 350mg**
> Theanine is a naturally occurring amino acid that‘s found almost exclusively in the tea plant. L-Theanine has the ability to cross the blood-brain barrier and block the binding of L-Glutamic Acid to Glutamate receptors in the brain, which results in the release of specific neurotransmitters that work to reduce feelings of stress and anxiety without a sedative effect. When used before exercise, L-Theanine has been shown to improve reaction times and reduce feelings of tiredness and mental fatigue. L-theanine works synergistically with stimulants. When it is combined with caffeine it provides a nootropic effect – a supplement used to boost cognitive ability. 

### **Citrulline Malate 8g**
> A blend of L-Citrulline and Malic Acid, Increases nitric oxide production, increase blood flow to active muscles. 

### Betaine 2.5g
> Also know as trimethylglycine, it is a naturally-occurring derivative of the amino acid glycine which may improve exercise performance by increasing rates of creatine synthesis, elevating levels of blood nitric oxide, and promoting fluid and thermal homeostasis

### **Beta-Alanine 3.6g**
> Enhances performance by increasing exercise capacity and decreasing muscle fatigue. It does this by acting as an intramuscular buffering protein to increase carnosine levels, which helps to buffer acid from the muscles, reduce lactic acid buildup, and thus enables you to work longer and harder without hitting the wall of fatigue. The consumption of 4-6 g β-alanine per day over a period of at least 2 weeks has been demonstrated to improve high-intensity exercise performance.
