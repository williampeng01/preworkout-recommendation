Important Ingredients
=============
***The ingredients are measured by serving***

### Caffeine 150mg
> An adenosine receptor antagonist and has been shown to acutely improve cognition as well as performance during endurance, power, and resistance exercise when consumed in dosages between 3 and 6 mg/kg bodyweight.

### L-Theanine 100mg
> Theanine it is a naturally occurring amino acid that‘s found almost exclusively in the tea plant. L-Theanine has the ability to cross the blood-brain barrier and block the binding of L-Glutamic Acid to Glutamate receptors in the brain, which results in the release of specific neurotransmitters that work to reduce feelings of stress and anxiety without a sedative effect. When used before exercise, L-Theanine has been shown to improve reaction times and reduce feelings of tiredness and mental fatigue. L-theanine works synergistically with stimulants. When it is combined with caffeine it provides a nootropic effect – a supplement used to boost cognitive ability. 

### L-Citrulline 6g
> Increases nitric oxide production, and increases blood flow to active muscles. Mixed with Malic Acid to produce Citrulline Malate
