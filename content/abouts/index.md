Ingredients
=============

[Stimulants](https://adf.org.au/drug-facts/stimulants/)
-------------
### Caffeine
>  An adenosine receptor antagonist and has been shown to acutely improve cognition as well as performance during endurance, power, and resistance exercise when consumed in dosages between 3 and 6 mg/kg bodyweight.


[Nootropics](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/326379)
-------------

### Taurine
> An amino-containing sulfonic acid that has been reported to have antioxidant, metabolic, and ergogenic effects. While chronic consumption of the substance may improve time-to-exhaustion during endurance. exercise, acute ingestion of 1.5 g taurine as part of a MIPS has been shown to improve muscular endurance during resistance exercise. 
### Theanine
> Also called L-Theanine, it is a naturally occurring amino acid that‘s found almost exclusively in the tea plant. L-Theanine has the ability to cross the blood-brain barrier and block the binding of L-Glutamic Acid to Glutamate receptors in the brain, which results in the release of specific neurotransmitters that work to reduce feelings of stress and anxiety without a sedative effect. When used before exercise, L-Theanine has been shown to improve reaction times and reduce feelings of tiredness and mental fatigue. L-theanine works synergistically with stimulants. When it is combined with caffeine it provides a nootropic effect – a supplement used to boost cognitive ability. 

### Tyrosine
> Also called L-Tyrosine. It is directly involved in the creation of the neurotransmitter’s dopamine and adrenaline, a family of hormones called catecholamines. Supplementing with L-Tyrosine can be particularly useful during times when we are under stress and have an increased demand for both neurotransmitters and catecholamine hormones. Consuming Tyrosine prior to training will increase dopamine and adrenaline release which improves exercise tolerance, motivation and focus.

[No Precursors](https://www.gssiweb.org/sports-science-exchange/article/sse-156-dietary-nitric-oxide-precursors-and-exercise-performance)
-------------
### L-arginine
>an amino acid that is a precursor required for the synthesis of nitric oxide.
### L-Citrulline 
>a non-essential amino acid found primarily in watermelon that is converted to L-arginine and thus promotes NO synthesis.
### Citrulline malate 
> A blend of L-Citrulline and Malic Acid, it has been shown to increase vasodilation and improve exercise performance when consumed chronically in doses of 6-8 g per day.
### Betaine (trimethylglycine)
> Also know as trimethylglycine, it is a naturally-occurring derivative of the amino acid glycine which may improve exercise performance by increasing rates of creatine synthesis, elevating levels of blood nitric oxide, and promoting fluid and thermal homeostasis

[Creatine](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/what-is-creatine)
-------------
> Creatine is a naturally-occurring amino acid found in the muscle of various animals. Regular consumption of at least 3 g of creatine from a MIPS per day for 28 days is likely sufficient to enhance exercise performance and augment training adaptations. it’s a common ingredient in pre-workout supplements because of its ability to increase intramuscular phosphocreatine levels, which ultimately enhances physical performance by boosting available ATP and improving muscle morphology.



[Beta-alanine](https://www.webmd.com/vitamins-and-supplements/beta-alanine-uses-and-risks)
-------------
> Enhances performance by increasing exercise capacity and decreasing muscle fatigue. It does this by acting as an intramuscular buffering protein to increase carnosine levels, which helps to buffer acid from the muscles, reduce lactic acid buildup, and thus enables you to work longer and harder without hitting the wall of fatigue. The consumption of 4-6 g β-alanine per day over a period of at least 2 weeks has been demonstrated to improve high-intensity exercise performance.

[BCAAs](https://www.webmd.com/vitamins/ai/ingredientmono-1005/branched-chain-amino-acids)
-------------
> The branched-chain amino acids comprise leucine, isoleucine, and valine, and are added to pre-workouts, or sometimes taken on their own, to increase the rate of muscle protein synthesis, reduce muscle protein breakdown, reduce exercise-induced muscle damage, and decrease the extent to which you experience delayed onset muscle soreness.


[Leucine](https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/encyclopedia/content.aspx?contenttypeid=19&contentid=Leucine)
-------------
> It is considered to be the main and most important BCAA amino acid for the many benefits it provides to the body. It is particularly popular for its ability to build muscles and activate a protein known as mTOR, which triggers muscle protein synthesis. Of course, isoleucine and valine also help activate mTOR, but not in such strength as leucine. Leucine plays an essential role in muscle recovery. 

[Thermogenics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermogenics)
-------------
### L-Carnitine
> L-Carnitine helps tranform body fat into energy. It also helps decreasing physical and mental fatigue. The qualities make it beneficial for focus and cutting.
### CLA
> The abbreviation for conjugated linoleic acid, also helps reduce body fat and increase focus.
### Caffeine
> An adenosine receptor antagonist and has been shown to acutely improve cognition as well as performance during endurance, power, and resistance exercise when consumed in dosages between 3 and 6 mg/kg bodyweight.
### Green Tea Extract
> Contains theanine. Can improve metabolism, digestion, and focus.
### Capsicum/Cayenne
> Helps increase digestion


[Additives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_additive)
-------------

### Citric Acid
>Manufacturers use citric acid to make their pre-workout powders more water soluble. Otherwise, you would have a hard time mixing them with liquids.

### Calcium Silicate and Silicon Dioxide
> Both are [anti-caking agents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticaking_agent) that absorb moisture and allow powder to flow freely.

### Cellulose gum
> A thickening agent, a completely natural product that is derived from the cell walls of plants. Typically it comes from wood pulp and cotton seeds. it can also be used as a stabilizer in food and non-food products. It can reduce acidity, pH balance, also used as an absorbing agent. It can absorb a certain amount of oil in fried foods and it absorbs water up to 20 times of its weight. For this reason it is sometimes used to maintain the moisture in certain foods as well.

### Xanthan Gum 
> Typically used for its ability to thicken or stabilize packaged goods.

### Carrageenan
> A natural emulsifier made from red seaweed and is used in food products to add thickness and viscosity.


[Electrolytes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrolyte)
-------------

### Magnesium Chloride 
> Helps You Recover From Exercise Quicker

### Sodium Citrate
> The ingestion of 0.5 g of sodium citrate/kg body mass shortly before a 5 km running time trial improves performance in well trained college runners. (Oöpik V, Saaremets I, Medijainen L, Karelson K, Janson T, Timpmann S. Effects of sodium citrate ingestion before exercise on endurance performance in well trained college runners. Br J Sports Med. 2003 Dec;37(6):485-9. doi: 10.1136/bjsm.37.6.485. PMID: 14665584; PMCID: PMC1724692.)

### Sodium Chloride
> Reduce your risk of being depleted of sodium, especially during the first 60 to 90 minutes of training. Increase blood volume.

### Potassium and Magnesium
> Lowers blood pressure.

### Dipotassium Phosphate
> A convenient source of potassium, which contributes to your normal muscle function. is commonly used for the properties that make it effective as an emulsifier, stabiliser and texturiser.

### Disodium Phosphate
> Helps retain water/prevent dehydration
