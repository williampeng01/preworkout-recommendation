Important Ingredients
=============
***The ingredients are measured by serving***

### Creatine 3g
> Creatine is a naturally-occurring amino acid found in the muscle of various animals. Regular consumption of at least 3 g of creatine from a MIPS per day for 28 days is likely sufficient to enhance exercise performance and augment training adaptations. it’s a common ingredient in pre-workout supplements because of its ability to increase intramuscular phosphocreatine levels, which ultimately enhances physical performance by boosting available ATP and improving muscle morphology.


### **Beta-Alanine 1.5g
> Enhances performance by increasing exercise capacity and decreasing muscle fatigue. It does this by acting as an intramuscular buffering protein to increase carnosine levels, which helps to buffer acid from the muscles, reduce lactic acid buildup, and thus enables you to work longer and harder without hitting the wall of fatigue. The consumption of 4-6 g β-alanine per day over a period of at least 2 weeks has been demonstrated to improve high-intensity exercise performance.

### **Citrulline Malate 1.5g**
> Increases nitric oxide production, increase blood flow to active muscles. 

### **L-Carnitine 375mg**
> L-Carnitine helps tranform body fat into energy. It also helps decreasing physical and mental fatigue. The qualities make it beneficial for focus and cutting.

### **Tyrosine 250mg**
> Also called L-Tyrosine. It is directly involved in the creation of the neurotransmitter’s dopamine and adrenaline, a family of hormones called catecholamines. Supplementing with L-Tyrosine can be particularly useful during times when we are under stress and have an increased demand for both neurotransmitters and catecholamine hormones. Consuming Tyrosine prior to training will increase dopamine and adrenaline release which improves exercise tolerance, motivation and focus.

### **Caffeine 175mg**
>  An adenosine receptor antagonist and has been shown to acutely improve cognition as well as performance during endurance, power, and resistance exercise when consumed in dosages between 3 and 6 mg/kg bodyweight.

### Tea extract
> Contains theanine. Can improve metabolism, digestion, and focus.

### **Magnesium Chloride**
> Helps You Recover From Exercise Quicker

### **Sodium Citrate**
> The ingestion of 0.5 g of sodium citrate/kg body mass shortly before a 5 km running time trial improves performance in well trained college runners. (Oöpik V, Saaremets I, Medijainen L, Karelson K, Janson T, Timpmann S. Effects of sodium citrate ingestion before exercise on endurance performance in well trained college runners. Br J Sports Med. 2003 Dec;37(6):485-9. doi: 10.1136/bjsm.37.6.485. PMID: 14665584; PMCID: PMC1724692.)
