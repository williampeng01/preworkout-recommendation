Important Ingredients
=============
***The ingredients are measured by serving***

### **Caffeine 150mg**
> An adenosine receptor antagonist and has been shown to acutely improve cognition as well as performance during endurance, power, and resistance exercise when consumed in dosages between 3 and 6 mg/kg bodyweight.

### **Tyrosine 1g**
> It is directly involved in the creation of the neurotransmitterâ€™s dopamine and adrenaline, a family of hormones called catecholamines. Supplementing with L-Tyrosine can be particularly useful during times when we are under stress and have an increased demand for both neurotransmitters and catecholamine hormones. Consuming Tyrosine prior to training will increase dopamine and adrenaline release which improves exercise tolerance, motivation and focus.
